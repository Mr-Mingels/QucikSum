Quick-Sum is a full-stack URL summarization application optimized for summarizing articles and blog posts


The common functionalities are:

- The application accepts URLs of articles or blog posts to generate summaries. The URL should be valid and in the correct format
- A drop-down menu is provided for users to select their desired summarization type
- Quick-Sum provides three types of summarization: Default, Bullet Point, and Executive. These options cater to different user needs and preferences for content consumption
- When the "Summarize" button is clicked, Quick-Sum will verify the input URL and summarization type before sending a request to an external API for summarization
- The application incorporates error handling for common issues such as empty input field, invalid URL format, and issues with fetching the summarization
- In the FAQ section, users can find answers to common questions. Each question can be clicked to expand and display the answer. This can help users understand how to use Quick-Sum effectively and troubleshoot common issues

I'm using the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/product) to get the summarization
